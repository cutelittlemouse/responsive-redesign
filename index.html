        <h2>Section 1: Identifying Usability Problems</h2>
        <div class="s1">

        <p>
        I selected <a href="https://www.rilandtrusts.org/">this website</a> because it's the website of a local organization with simply yet poorly-designed elements.</p>
        <h3>Problems:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Due to randomly placed text and font size, the website doesn’t have an apparent visual flow to follow, therefore it’s difficult for first-time users to navigate</li>
            <li>Images have poor quality and aren’t arranged in an attractive way</li>
            <li>Similar color of text and background doesn’t show enough contrast</li>
            <li>Log in button located at the bottom left is difficult to be found, even for returning users</li>
            <li>Content in the navigation bar is too plentiful and doesn’t follow reasonable logic</li>
            <li>Links that appear as underlined text look unprofessional and can be replaced with buttons</li>
            <li>Contact information is placed in two different places</li>
            <li>The overall design can be more aesthetically pleasing</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Accessbility problems:</h3>
        <p class="s">Contrast error is a major problem identified by the accessibility evaluation tool, which I agree that text can be difficult to see under complex lighting and screen circumstances. It also points out that the images lack alternative text, which can be an important problem when the image fails to load. The tool also alerts redundant links going to the same URL (the image and the underlined title both lead to the RI Walks challenge page). I believe this is unnecessary to change, but I’ll still improve it due to minimalist design principles. </p>
